<br><br>
<h3>Determination of Winners</h3> Winners will be picked from a objective ranking by the demo community, combined with evaluation by a panel of experts. The experts and demo community will see a shortlist of the submitted demos, selected by the Demoparty team within 4 days. We are shortlisting the demos beforehand to reduce the amount of work for the judges.
<br><br>
Judging duties will be split between these groups as described below. All public ranking and expert judging will occur during the Judging Period between 12:00 noon GMT on Sunday, August 14 and 11:00 a.m. GMT on Saturday, August 28. Community Voting/Ranking: Any member of the demo community (developers, sceners, artists, fans, media) may vote. Community members will need a valid e-mail address to verify their rankings by e-mail. Limit one review per person and per email address per Entry. Any attempt to submit additional reviews or rankings for the same Entry by any means, including but not limited to multiple email addresses, aliases, automated reviews, use of contest services, payoffs or promises to others in exchange for rankings, or anything else that is inconsistent with getting an honest picture of the public’s genuine opinion of your entry, is grounds for immediate disqualification of the person submitting (or inducing) such rankings/voting, as well as the Entry that is the subject of such activity. Sponsor reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to determine which forms for voting activity may be deemed to violate the spirit of this rule and therefore to be invalid, and also to disqualify and exclude from this Contest and any other contest Sponsor may offer any person(s) engaged in activity that violates any provision of these rules or is otherwise deemed by Sponsor, in its discretion, to be inappropriate, unsportsmanlike or disruptive to the integrity or intended functioning of this Contest.Additional details of the mechanism for community members to register their rankings of entries will be posted online at http://mozillalabs.com/demoparty during the Judging Period. Expert Judging: In addition to public rankings, a panel of expert judges, selected by Sponsor, will review the Entries. Each expert judge will be assigned to a category and to review it's shortlisted demos. After they do their initial review, judges will be encouraged to review a handful more of the top entries (determined by community) that pique their interest. Experts will not be allowed to review or rank entries from people they know personally. Criteria for Evaluation: The expert judges will rank their favorite demos, and give a one-liner why they decided to do so. Judgement will be objective, but there are no real metrics for a "good" or "bad" art piece.
<br><br>
The community will evaluate on a 1-5 scale in a single dimension for overall appeal. To avoid skewing, an entry will need to receive rankings from a minimum threshold number of community members (number to be determined based on overall participation levels) to receive an official community score (similar to the requirement for a baseball player to have a minimum number of at-bats in order to receive an official batting average).
<br><br>
<h3>Scoring</h3> The ranking/score for an entry will be determined to 50% by the average of the scores an entry earns from each expert judge, and to 50% the average of the community’s official score. In the event of a tie, the expert judges will re-evaluate the tied entries to determine the winner. An entry may only win one prize and will earn the highest prize for which it qualifies, opening its spot in the running for lower prizes to the next most qualified entry. All determinations by the judges and sponsor on implementing the contest, including but not limited to determination of the winners, are final and binding.
<br><br>
<h3>Prize Categories</h3> There will be the following categories:
	•	Main Web Demo
